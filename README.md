## 🚀 About Me 
I’m a data analyst passionate about helping organizations make sense of their data and turn it into clear, actionable insights. I enjoy transforming messy, complex datasets into clean reporting and meaningful stories that support better decision-making.

I’m interested in working across both business and healthcare, including hospital environments where data can directly improve efficiency and outcomes. My focus is on building dashboards that people actually use, automating repetitive tasks, and creating reports that help teams stay aligned and informed.

Outside of data, I enjoy playing soccer as I played college in soccer as a student athlete, and I’m always learning new ways to sharpen my skills. I love the “aha!” moment when the numbers reveal something unexpected—and it turns into an insight that makes a real difference.
